Simple Hangman game that was made as part of an excersise at Technobel. There is a version that uses more words that I gathered in the "FrenchWords" folder but I visibly never uploaded it to github, probably because I made that update for fun during my free time after the fact. So there is only one word per difficulty but I figured I would make it public as is since it is so old :)
